/// @brief ROS 2 node that declutters a Livox point cloud before it reaches
/// FAST-LIO or
///        the obstacle costmap.
///
/// Applies radius outlier removal: a point survives only if at least
/// `min_neighbors` other points fall within `search_radius_m` of it. Airborne
/// dust and sand thrown up by the robot's own wheels scatters light diffusely
/// and returns as isolated points with no coherent surface behind them, whereas
/// a solid obstacle returns a dense cluster at the sensor's angular resolution
/// -- so this separates the two structurally rather than by reflectivity, which
/// real low-reflectivity hazards can share with dust.
///
/// Implemented directly against the raw PointCloud2 buffer with a uniform voxel
/// grid (cell size equal to the search radius) rather than a PCL-based kd-tree,
/// so that each point only checks its 27 neighbouring cells instead of every
/// other point, and so that fields the Livox driver defines beyond
/// x/y/z/intensity -- tag, line, timestamp, all of which FAST-LIO's own
/// preprocessing reads -- pass through untouched instead of being dropped by a
/// conversion to a plain XYZI point type.
///
/// This is a single-frame, low-latency pass deliberately kept simple: its job
/// is to keep dust out of FAST-LIO's persistent ikd-tree map (built from every
/// point in a scan regardless of whether that point influenced the scan's pose
/// estimate -- see MapIncremental in FAST-LIO's laserMapping.cpp), not to catch
/// every dust return outright. A fixed search radius is also less selective
/// close to the sensor, where its angular resolution already packs points
/// tighter regardless of what they hit -- if dust near the robot is still
/// getting through, that is the parameter to revisit before reaching for a
/// heavier, multi-frame technique.
