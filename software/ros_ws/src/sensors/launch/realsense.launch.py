"""
RealSense camera launch.

Every RealSense driver setting lives in `config/realsense.yaml`. This launch file
deliberately exposes nothing but the stream toggles, since those are the only settings
worth changing per run:

    enable_depth       depth stream
    enable_infra_pair  the infra1/infra2 IR pair (infra0 is a config file setting)
    enable_color       color stream

The defaults match the baseline setup: color and depth on, IR off.

Compressed topics need no nodes here. The driver publishes through image_transport, so
every image topic gains a `/compressed` (and depth a `/compressedDepth`) companion from
the plugins sensors depends on.

Usage:
    ros2 launch sensors realsense.launch.py

    ros2 launch sensors realsense.launch.py \
        enable_infra_pair:=true enable_color:=false
