"""Launch the localisation stack: FAST-LIO odometry fused by the EKF.

Three pieces, and the split matters:

  1. fast_lio provides LiDAR-inertial odometry from config/livox_mid360.yaml, reading the
     raw Livox cloud directly off common.lid_topic (/livox/lidar). It publishes /Odometry
     as odom -> base_link and broadcasts no TF of its own.
  2. ekf.launch.py runs robot_localization from config/ekf_config.yaml, fusing that pose
     with IMU angular velocity and owning the odom -> base_link transform.
  3. flat_footprint_broadcaster flattens that transform into odom -> base_footprint, from
     config/footprint_broadcaster.yaml. nav2 is what consumes the frame, but it is derived
     from the EKF output rather than from anything nav2 provides, so it belongs here: the
     frame then exists whenever localisation is running. Note that no base_footprint link
     exists in the URDF, deliberately -- a static base_link -> base_footprint from
     robot_state_publisher would give the frame a second parent and TF would reject it.

Two monitors ride along with them, both watching what this stack produces rather than
adding to it: the mobility watchdog, which compares commanded velocity against the EKF
output to catch sustained wheel slip, and the health monitor, which reports the rate and
staleness of the topics above on /health_check/health.

Start order does not matter. fast_lio withholds /Odometry until lid_frame -> base_frame
resolves in TF, so until robot_state_publisher is up the EKF runs on the IMU alone.

Map saving is handled inside fast_lio, via the pcd_save block of livox_mid360.yaml:
periodically, on shutdown, and on demand via the /map_save service.

The config is tuned for the real robot. Pass sim:=true against Gazebo, which publishes a
differently shaped cloud -- see sim_overrides() for exactly what changes and why.

    Gazebo publishes x,y,z,intensity,ring. The real Livox driver publishes

    into, so against the sim, type 4 finds no `line` field and reads the scan-line index as 0
    for every point -- collapsing all points onto one line and wrecking the per-point
    timestamps that motion compensation depends on. Type 2 reads `ring`, which the sim does
    provide, and derives times from azimuth when no per-point time is present.

    scan_line is the number of lines to expect: 32 vertical samples in the sim, against 4 real
    scan lines on a MID-360. The Velodyne handler skips points whose ring exceeds it.

    lid_topic needs no override: Gazebo's ±Inf no-return rays are rejected by the preprocess
    handlers now, so the raw topic is safe to consume directly.
